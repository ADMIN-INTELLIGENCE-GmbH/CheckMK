# ntfy.sh Push Notification Script for Checkmk

This script sends push notifications from Checkmk directly to your ntfy.sh server and links each alert to the specific host or service in monitoring. It supports channels, priorities, custom tags, authentication (basic and token), and rich messages.

# General

Since ntfy.sh is our new push notification service and no suitable script was available, this solution was custom-built for robust Checkmk integration.  
Each notification contains a direct link to the affected host or service for instant access in your monitoring interface.

The script is actively maintained and works reliably as of now.

# Installation

Copy the script to your Checkmk server notifications directory and make it executable:

```
$OMD_ROOT/local/share/check_mk/notifications/ntfy.sh
chmod +x $OMD_ROOT/local/share/check_mk/notifications/ntfy.sh
```

After deployment, select **ntfy.sh** as your notification method in Checkmkâ€™s notification settings:

3.  **Monitoring System URL:** The base URL (domain) of your Checkmk or monitoring system, e.g. `https://monitoring.company.com`
4.  _(Optional)_ Username for basic authentication OR _Token_ (starts with `tk_`) for token auth
